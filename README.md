# auto-aither
## What is this?
auto-aither is a python3 script which provides a convenient and easy to use interface for each step of the torrent upload process. This includes 
- .torrent file generation 
- taking and uploading screenshots and mediainfo
- proper naming and categorisation

It can then upload all this directly to aither.cc. You can also use the script in a modular fashion if you just want to do one certain thing.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ser4ph2/auto-aither.git

cd auto-aither

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

chmod +x main.py

./main.py
```

Obviously you will need Python3 and pip3 installed. To install these:

```bash
apt install python3

apt install python3-pip
```

You also need ffmpeg and mktorrent installed.

```bash
apt install mktorrent

apt install ffmpeg
```

## FAQ
- What is my PID and where do I find it?

Your PID allows the tracker to identify you in the swarm. This is how it tracks your upload/download amount etc. If someone else discovers your PID they could download torrents using it and all data transfer would be attributed to your account.

Your PID can be located by clicking your profile picture in the top right > Security > Pass Key

- What is my API key and where do I find it?

Your API key is a unique token that allows your account to authenticate with the site without the usual username/password. This is useful in scripts such as this where it is easier not to.
